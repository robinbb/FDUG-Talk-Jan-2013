FDUG-Talk-Jan-2013
==================

Slides for my tech talk at FDUG on 16 Jan 2013.

Effective software development in conventional programming languages (like C++, Java, or C#)
requires knowledge of programming idioms. These idioms, the most popular of which were well
documented in the Gang of Four (GoF) book “Design Patterns”, are well known to professional
programmers. How do conventional programming language expressions of these idioms map to modern
functional programming languages like Clojure and Haskell? This talk answers the question with
concrete examples, and aims to show that each of the GoF design patterns are better expressed,
or not even necessary, in the modern functional programming languages. No prior knowledge of
Clojure or Haskell is necessary.
